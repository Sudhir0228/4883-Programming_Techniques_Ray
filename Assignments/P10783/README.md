# Odd Sum - 10783
### Input
There can be at multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T
(1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100)
in two separate lines.

### Output
For each test case you are to print one line of output – the serial number of the test case followed by
the summation of the odd integers in the range [a, b].

### Sample Input
```
2
1
5
3
5
```
### Sample Output
```
Case 1: 9
Case 2: 8
```
