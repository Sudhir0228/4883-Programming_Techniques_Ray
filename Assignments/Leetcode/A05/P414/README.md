# 414. Third Maximum Number
### Question
Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
### Output
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.

### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```
