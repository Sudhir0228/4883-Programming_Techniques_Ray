# 367. Valid Perfect Square
### Question
Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

### Output
Example 1:
Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.

Example 2:
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.

### Constraints:
```
1 <= num <= 231 - 1
```
