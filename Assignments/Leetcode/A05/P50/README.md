# 50. Pow(x, n)
### Question
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

### Output
Example 1:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000

Example 2:
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100

Example 3:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

### Constraints:
```
-100.0 < x < 100.0
-231 <= n <= 231-1
n is an integer.
Either x is not zero or n > 0.
-104 <= xn <= 104
```
