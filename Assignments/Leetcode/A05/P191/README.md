# 191. Number of 1 Bits 
### Question
Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Output
Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

### Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 231 - 1
```
