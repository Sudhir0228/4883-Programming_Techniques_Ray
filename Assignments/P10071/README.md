# Back to High School Physics - 10071
### Input
The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers
denote the value of v (−100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 200) (t means at the time the particle gains
that velocity)

### Output
For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.

### Sample Input
```
0 0
5 12
```
### Sample Output
```
0
120
```
